# _Tap Room Makeover_

#### _An angular/react hybrid application for a bar to track their kegs, Created 4/26/19_

#### By _**Micaela Jawor**_

## Specifications
* _As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price, and alcohol Content or flavor_
* _As an employee, I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to add it to the list_
* _As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake_
* _As an employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg (A full keg has roughly 124 pints)_
* _As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1_
* _As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them_
* _As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. Perhaps based on their price(greater or less than $5 per pint, perhaps) or the particular style of beer_
* _As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers_

## Routing Structure
